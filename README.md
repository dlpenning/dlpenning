Hello!

I am a third year student at the Technical University of Eindhoven, doing my bachelor computer science and engineering! Currently I am a part of the student team [Mitra](https://github.com/Mitra-Health) (more about them on their [page](https://github.com/Mitra-Health))!

Some of my projects:
- JSNative compiler -- compiles JS into C.
